Indeed, finding, hiring and training new employees can be very expensive, and loosing employees usually results in a loss of knowledge. \n","And while it is likely that many factors influence a company's employee retention, determining an adequate salary for each employee is a crucial part of an efficient retention strategy. \n","Hence, for this project, we thought it would be interesting to try to answer three questions: \n","- what makes an employee likely to quit their job (called 'attrition' in our dataset)? \n","- what factors influence pay rate?\n","- are pay rate and an employee's likeliness to quit related?\n","\n","We found these questions interesting because they have a real-world impact, and in a business setting could produce helpful insights that an HR team could leverage. \n","\n","However, answering these questions will require us to build a model able to predict if an employee is still working at the company or if they have left. And as mentioned above, we will also try to understand what influences an employee's pay rate, and see if these two questions are related. These objectives might be ambitious, but we do think that as part of our investigation around employees' attrition, we will also have to investigate pay rate.

We are aware that we must answer at least two questions, but the questions we picked will require a lot of investigating, so a good organization and strong team work will be crucial to our success. To make sure we hit our goals, I am planning on setting smaller goals and deadlines for the team, me included.\n","And as the  manager I think my biggest challenge will to ensure our project is cohesive: we will be working on different questions, but since they are related we will need to communicate efficiently and often. To address this, I'm planning on having regular meetings with everyone so we can talk about what we're doing/our findings. I also assigned myself to both models we will make, that way I can not only support Eric and Andrew, but also serve as the 'link' between the two main research questions.\n","\n","For the research question about attrition, our goal is to find a model that will predict with 90% accuracy if an employee stays or leaves a company.\n","Similarily, for the research question around pay rate, a model with an r^2 value above 0.8 accuracy will be considered a sucess.\n","As for the question 'are pay rate and an employee's likeliness to quit related?', we will not be building a model so any answer supported by data analysis and the other two models will be suficient. However, since we do not have a lot of experience on building models, being able to explain what our models do (why we get the predictions that we are getting) and have a compelling analysis to support this explanation is also a goal we have as a team. \n","\n","Finally, concerning our dataset, it seems clean: we have very few nan values but some columns have ints encoded as object while others are strings and will need to be encoded (for instance, employee source).
