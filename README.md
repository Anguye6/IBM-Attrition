# IBM-Attrition: MATH-3439-01
IBM Attrition for Math 3439

Utilizing the IBM Attrition dataset(csv) we focused on factors that would make attrition which is the rate of which 
employees will quit their jobs or not. Our initial hypothesis was to see how pay rate would affect that since salary 
is generally associated with whether or not someone will quit their jobs or not. And we would predict whether or not 
employees would quit their jobs or not with different models such as decision trees and gradient boosting for hyperparameter
tuning. And we eventually got a .8 prediction with our best model for the TPR which shows that our predicition that was predicted
to be right was actually right.
